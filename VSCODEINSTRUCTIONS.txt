Sequence of steps to do
  
    one time:  
        install a C/C++ complier, add to PATH environment variable  
        install C/C++ plugin for visual studio code  
        tell visual studio code where the compiler is and what is the short cut to build and run  
           these are files under ".vscode" (see below)
    every project:  
        crate a project  
        build project  
        run project  
Explaination(one time)
    A. Install a compiler (if you don't have one already)  
    Example below, installs MinGW c++ compiler on Windows:  
    Download from here: https://sourceforge.net/p/mingw-w64/mailman/message/36103143/  
    1. For windows, I downloaded https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/mingw-w64/mingw-w64-release/mingw-w64-v5.0.3.zip  
    2. unzip mingw-w64-v5.0.3.zip  
    3. rename unzipped folder to MinGW, Move it to C:\MinGW\  
    4. verify that you have "C:\MinGW\bin\gcc.exe" director/file, otherwise make necessary change to folder  

    B. Add your compiler to PATH environment variable
    1. Add "C:\MinGW\bin" to PATH > user environment variable  
    2. verify gcc command works from cmd  
        restart your cmd  
        run below command in 'cmd'  
            where gcc  
            The output should be: C:\MinGW\bin\gcc.exe  

    C. Restart your visual studio code  
    1. install C/C++ plugin, as below:  
        From Menu  
             View > Extension  
        Search & Install below extension  
            C/C++  
    Explaination(Every Project)
        A. Create a below "myproj" folder & files, like below in below structure:  
            C:\myproj\myfile.cpp  
            C:\myproj\.vscode\  
            C:\myproj\.vscode\c_cpp_properties.json  
            C:\myproj\.vscode\launch.json  
            C:\myproj\.vscode\settings.json  
            C:\myproj\.vscode\tasks.json 
            The data for this files can bee seen in vs codeinstrucions folder
